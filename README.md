# Toontown Rewritten Doodle Trainer v5.0

This is a tool for using the speed chat UI in ToonTown to say tricks for your doodle to perform. This was made for educational purposes only.

## Prerequisites

Must be on a Windows-based operating system. Python3 is necessary for this to work. Python 3.11 was used to compile and test the program, but any Python version past this or the latest should work just fine.

## Download Files via Releases Tab

[Release v5.0](https://github.com/mchendrickson/doodleTrainer/releases/tag/v5.0)

Just run doodle_trainer.exe while you're logged into Toontown Rewritten and follow the instructions in the CLI. CMD, PowerShell, or Windows Terminal should all work as well.

## Best Practices

I recommend that you do all the following to have the best experience with this tool.

- Only have 1 Toontown account running on the computer you are running the script on.
- Run the tool for no more than 6 hours at a time.
- Stand on the edge of a roof at your toon estate, this will stop doodle from pushing you around.

## Troubleshooting

**It doesn't click the buttons accurately**

Make sure you are using a resolution that has an aspect ratio of 16:9. Ideally, use 1920 x 1080p. Make sure any scaling or other Windows nonsense is turned off (set to default values or 100%) in your display settings.

**It crashes immediately when I launch it**

Make sure you have python installed. If this doesn't help, run it in a CMD and post the error message in the issues page
