# Toontown Rewritten Doodle Trainer v5.0

This is a tool for using the speed chat UI in ToonTown to say tricks for your doodle to perform. This was made for educational purposes only.

## Prerequisites

Must be on a Windows-based operating system. Python3 is necessary for this to work.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Download Files via Releases Tab

[Release v5.0](https://github.com/mchendrickson/doodleTrainer/releases/tag/v5.0)

Just run doodle_trainer.exe while you're logged into Toontown Rewritten and follow the instructions in the CLI. CMD, PowerShell, or Windows Terminal should all work as well.

## Best Practices

I recommend that you do all the following to have the best experience with this tool.

- Only have 1 Toontown account running on the computer you are running the script on.
- Run the tool for no more than 6 hours at a time.
- Stand on the edge of a roof at your toon estate, this will stop doodle from pushing you around.
